### Hobbyist programmer and data analyst with a passion for video games, meteorology and foreign languages

Ever since I was a kid, I loved playing video games. But my hardware was always out of date, so I had to find other ways to enjoy them. Thus I started tinkering with servers and web technologies. Later on I was considering IT studies, but I ended up majoring in economics. At the same, during my career I always looked for opportunities to show my technical skills, even if I wasn't directly paid for that.

I have some exciting projects planned for 2024. Currently I am working on local connections search engine. I try not to limit myself to any specific technology or platform.
I am also quite a big fan of using generative AI tools.
