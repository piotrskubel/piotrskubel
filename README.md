### Hobbyist programmer and data analyst with a passion for video games, meteorology and linguistics.

Ever since I was a kid, I loved playing video games. But my hardware was always out of date, so I had to find other ways to enjoy them. Thus I started tinkering with servers and web technologies. Later on I was considering IT studies, but I ended up majoring in economics. During my career I always looked for opportunities to show my technical skills, even if I wasn't paid directly for them. In 2022, I decided to take my programming skills to the next level.

I have some exciting projects planned for 2024, where I will use generative AI elements. Although I work mainly with Python, I try not to limit myself to any specific technology or platform.
